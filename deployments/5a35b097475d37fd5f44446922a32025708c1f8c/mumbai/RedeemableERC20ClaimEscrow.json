When some token is deposited the running total of that token against the trust is incremented by the deposited amount. When some `redeemableERC20` token holder calls `withdraw` they are sent the full balance they have not previously claimed, multiplied by their fraction of the redeemable token supply that they currently hold. As redeemable tokens are frozen after distribution there are no issues with holders manipulating withdrawals by transferring tokens to claim multiple times. As redeemable tokens can be burned it is possible for the total supply to decrease over time, which naively would result in claims being larger retroactively (prorata increases beyond what can be paid). For example: - Alice and Bob hold 50 rTKN each, 100 total supply - 100 TKN is deposited - Alice withdraws 50% of 100 TKN => alice holds 50 TKN escrow holds 50 TKN - Alice burns her 50 rTKN - Bob attempts to withdraw his 50 rTKN which is now 100% of supply - Escrow tries to pay 100% of 100 TKN deposited and fails as the escrow   only holds 50 TKN (alice + bob = 150%). To avoid the escrow allowing more withdrawals than deposits we include the total rTKN supply in the key of each deposit mapping, and include it in the emmitted event. Alice and Bob must read the events offchain and make a withdrawal relative to the rTKN supply as it was at deposit time. Many deposits can be made under a single rTKN supply and will all combine to a single withdrawal but deposits made across different supplies will require multiple withdrawals. Alice or Bob could burn their tokens before withdrawing and would simply withdraw zero or only some of the deposited TKN. This hurts them individually, so they SHOULD check their indexer for claimable assets in the escrow before considering a burn. But neither of them can cause the other to be able to withdraw more or less relative to the supply as it was at the time of TKN being deposited, or to trick the escrow into overpaying more TKN than was deposited under a given `Sale`. A griefer could attempt to flood the escrow with many dust deposits under many different supplies in an attempt to confuse alice/bob. They are free to filter out events in their indexer that come from an unknown depositor or fall below some dust value threshold. Tokens may also exit the escrow as an `undeposit` call where the depositor receives back the tokens they deposited. As above the depositor must provide the rTKN supply from `deposit` time in order to `undeposit`. As `withdraw` and `undeposit` both represent claims on the same tokens they are mutually exclusive outcomes, hence the need for an escrow. The escrow will process `withdraw` only if the `Sale` is reporting a complete and successful raise. Similarly `undeposit` will only return tokens after the `Sale` completes and reports failure. While the `Sale` is in active distribution neither `withdraw` or `undeposit` will move tokens. This is necessary in part because it is only safe to calculate entitlements once the redeemable tokens are fully distributed and frozen. Because much of the redeemable token supply will never be sold, and then burned, `depositPending` MUST be called rather than `deposit` while the raise is active. When the raise completes anon can call `sweepPending` which will calculate and emit a `Deposit` event for a useful `supply`. Any supported ERC20 token can be deposited at any time BUT ONLY under a `Sale` contract that is the child of the `TrustFactory` that the escrow is deployed for. `TrustEscrow` is used to prevent a `Sale` from changing the pass/fail outcome once it is known due to a bug/attempt to double spend escrow funds. This mechanism is very similar to the native burn mechanism on `redeemableERC20` itself under `redeem` but without requiring any tokens to be burned in the process. Users can claim the same token many times safely, simply receiving 0 tokens if there is nothing left to claim. This does NOT support rebase/elastic token _balance_ mechanisms on the escrowed token as the escrow has no way to track deposits/withdrawals other than 1:1 conservation of input/output. For example, if 100 tokens are deposited under two different trusts and then that token rebases all balances to half, there will be 50 tokens in the escrow but the escrow will attempt transfers up to 100 tokens between the two trusts. Essentially the first 50 tokens will send and the next 50 tokens will fail because the trust literally doesn't have 100 tokens at that point. Elastic _supply_ tokens are supported as every token to be withdrawn must be first deposited, with the caveat that if some mechanism can mint/burn/transfer tokens out from under the escrow contract directly, this will break internal accounting much like the rebase situation. Using a real-world example, stETH from LIDO would be NOT be supported as the balance changes every day to reflect incoming ETH from validators, but wstETH IS supported as balances remain static while the underlying assets per unit of wstETH increase each day. This is of course exactly why wstETH was created in the first place. Every escrowed token has a separate space in the deposited/withdrawn mappings so that some broken/malicious/hacked token that leads to incorrect token movement in/out of the escrow cannot impact other tokens, even for the same trust and redeemable.\",\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/escrow/RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow.sol\":\"RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\",\"useLiteralContent\":true},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":100000},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"content\":\"// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\\n// OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v4.6.0) (proxy/utils/Initializable.sol)\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.8.2;\\n\\nimport \\\"../../utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol\\\";\\n\\n/**\\n * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\\n * behind a proxy.

When some `redeemableERC20`\\n/// token holder calls `withdraw` they are sent the full balance they have not\\n/// previously claimed, multiplied by their fraction of the redeemable token\\n/// supply that they currently hold. As redeemable tokens are frozen after\\n/// distribution there are no issues with holders manipulating withdrawals by\\n/// transferring tokens to claim multiple times.\\n///\\n/// As redeemable tokens can be burned it is possible for the total supply to\\n/// decrease over time, which naively would result in claims being larger\\n/// retroactively (prorata increases beyond what can be paid).\\n///\\n/// For example:\\n/// - Alice and Bob hold 50 rTKN each, 100 total supply\\n/// - 100 TKN is deposited\\n/// - Alice withdraws 50% of 100 TKN => alice holds 50 TKN escrow holds 50 TKN\\n/// - Alice burns her 50 rTKN\\n/// - Bob attempts to withdraw his 50 rTKN which is now 100% of supply\\n/// - Escrow tries to pay 100% of 100 TKN deposited and fails as the escrow\\n///   only holds 50 TKN (alice + bob = 150%).\\n///\\n/// To avoid the escrow allowing more withdrawals than deposits we include the\\n/// total rTKN supply in the key of each deposit mapping, and include it in the\\n/// emmitted event. Alice and Bob must read the events offchain and make a\\n/// withdrawal relative to the rTKN supply as it was at deposit time. Many\\n/// deposits can be made under a single rTKN supply and will all combine to a\\n/// single withdrawal but deposits made across different supplies will require\\n/// multiple withdrawals.\\n///\\n/// Alice or Bob could burn their tokens before withdrawing and would simply\\n/// withdraw zero or only some of the deposited TKN. This hurts them\\n/// individually, so they SHOULD check their indexer for claimable assets in\\n/// the escrow before considering a burn. But neither of them can cause the\\n/// other to be able to withdraw more or less relative to the supply as it was\\n/// at the time of TKN being deposited, or to trick the escrow into overpaying\\n/// more TKN than was deposited under a given `Sale`.\\n///\\n/// A griefer could attempt to flood the escrow with many dust deposits under\\n/// many different supplies in an attempt to confuse alice/bob. They are free\\n/// to filter out events in their indexer that come from an unknown depositor\\n/// or fall below some dust value threshold.\\n///\\n/// Tokens may also exit the escrow as an `undeposit` call where the depositor\\n/// receives back the tokens they deposited. As above the depositor must\\n/// provide the rTKN supply from `deposit` time in order to `undeposit`.\\n///\\n/// As `withdraw` and `undeposit` both represent claims on the same tokens they\\n/// are mutually exclusive outcomes, hence the need for an escrow. The escrow\\n/// will process `withdraw` only if the `Sale` is reporting a complete and\\n/// successful raise. Similarly `undeposit` will only return tokens after the\\n/// `Sale` completes and reports failure. While the `Sale` is in active\\n/// distribution neither `withdraw` or `undeposit` will move tokens. This is\\n/// necessary in part because it is only safe to calculate entitlements once\\n/// the redeemable tokens are fully distributed and frozen.\\n///\\n/// Because much of the redeemable token supply will never be sold, and then\\n/// burned, `depositPending` MUST be called rather than `deposit` while the\\n/// raise is active. When the raise completes anon can call `sweepPending`\\n/// which will calculate and emit a `Deposit` event for a useful `supply`.\\n///\\n/// Any supported ERC20 token can be deposited at any time BUT ONLY under a\\n/// `Sale` contract that is the child of the `TrustFactory` that the escrow\\n/// is deployed for. `TrustEscrow` is used to prevent a `Sale` from changing\\n/// the pass/fail outcome once it is known due to a bug/attempt to double\\n/// spend escrow funds.\\n///\\n/// This mechanism is very similar to the native burn mechanism on\\n/// `redeemableERC20` itself under `redeem` but without requiring any tokens to\\n/// be burned in the process. Users can claim the same token many times safely,\\n/// simply receiving 0 tokens if there is nothing left to claim.\\n///\\n/// This does NOT support rebase/elastic token _balance_ mechanisms on the\\n/// escrowed token as the escrow has no way to track deposits/withdrawals other\\n/// than 1:1 conservation of input/output. For example, if 100 tokens are\\n/// deposited under two different trusts and then that token rebases all\\n/// balances to half, there will be 50 tokens in the escrow but the escrow will\\n/// attempt transfers up to 100 tokens between the two trusts. Essentially the\\n/// first 50 tokens will send and the next 50 tokens will fail because the\\n/// trust literally doesn't have 100 tokens at that point.\\n///\\n/// Elastic _supply_ tokens are supported as every token to be withdrawn must\\n/// be first deposited, with the caveat that if some mechanism can\\n/// mint/burn/transfer tokens out from under the escrow contract directly, this\\n/// will break internal accounting much like the rebase situation.\\n///\\n/// Using a real-world example, stETH from LIDO would be NOT be supported as\\n/// the balance changes every day to reflect incoming ETH from validators, but\\n/// wstETH IS supported as balances remain static while the underlying assets\\n/// per unit of wstETH increase each day. This is of course exactly why wstETH\\n/// was created in the first place.\\n///\\n/// Every escrowed token has a separate space in the deposited/withdrawn\\n/// mappings so that some broken/malicious/hacked token that leads to incorrect\\n/// token movement in/out of the escrow cannot impact other tokens, even for\\n/// the same trust and redeemable.\\ncontract RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow is SaleEscrow {\\n    using Math for uint256;\\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\\n\\n    /// Emitted for every successful pending deposit.\\n    /// @param sender Anon `msg.sender` depositing the token.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract deposit is under.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token that can claim this deposit.\\n    /// Implicitly snapshots the redeemable so malicious `Trust` cannot\\n    /// redirect funds later.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being deposited.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token deposited.\\n    event PendingDeposit(\\n        address sender,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Emitted every time a pending deposit is swept to a full deposit.\\n    /// @param sender Anon `msg.sender` sweeping the deposit.\\n    /// @param depositor Anon `msg.sender` who originally deposited the token.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract deposit is under.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token first reported by the trust.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being swept into a deposit.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token being swept into a deposit.\\n    event Sweep(\\n        address sender,\\n        address depositor,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Emitted for every successful deposit.\\n    /// @param sender Anon `msg.sender` triggering the deposit.\\n    /// MAY NOT be the `depositor` in the case of a pending sweep.\\n    /// @param depositor Anon `msg.sender` who originally deposited the token.\\n    /// MAY NOT be the current `msg.sender` in the case of a pending sweep.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract deposit is under.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token that can claim this deposit.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being deposited.\\n    /// @param supply rTKN supply at moment of deposit.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token deposited.\\n    event Deposit(\\n        address sender,\\n        address depositor,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 supply,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Emitted for every successful undeposit.\\n    /// @param sender Anon `msg.sender` undepositing the token.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract undeposit is from.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token that is being undeposited against.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being undeposited.\\n    /// @param supply rTKN supply at moment of deposit.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token undeposited.\\n    event Undeposit(\\n        address sender,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 supply,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Emitted for every successful withdrawal.\\n    /// @param withdrawer Anon `msg.sender` withdrawing the token.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract withdrawal is from.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token used to withdraw.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being withdrawn.\\n    /// @param supply rTKN supply at moment of deposit.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token withdrawn.\\n    event Withdraw(\\n        address withdrawer,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 supply,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Every time an address calls `withdraw` their withdrawals increases to\\n    /// match the current `totalDeposits` for that trust/token combination.\\n    /// The token amount they actually receive is only their prorata share of\\n    /// that deposited balance.

The deposit will be accounted for under both the depositor individually and the trust in aggregate. The aggregate value is used by `withdraw` and the individual value by `undeposit`. The depositor is responsible for approving the token for this contract. `deposit` is still enabled after the distribution ends; `undeposit` is always allowed in case of a fail and disabled on success. Multiple `deposit` calls before and after a success result are supported. If a depositor deposits when a raise has failed they will need to undeposit it again manually.

The problem with doing a normal deposit while the raise is still active is that the `Sale` will burn all unsold tokens when the raise ends. If we captured the token supply mid-raise then many deposited TKN would be allocated to unsold rTKN. Instead we set aside TKN so that raise participants can be sure that they will be claimable upon raise success but they remain unbound to any rTKN supply until `sweepPending` is called. `depositPending` is a one-way function, there is no way to `undeposit` until after the raise fails.

      }
    },
    "notice": "Escrow contract for ERC20 tokens to be deposited and withdrawn against redeemableERC20 tokens from a specific `Sale`. When some token is deposited the running total of that token against the trust is incremented by the deposited amount. When some `redeemableERC20` token holder calls `withdraw` they are sent the full balance they have not previously claimed, multiplied by their fraction of the redeemable token supply that they currently hold. As redeemable tokens are frozen after distribution there are no issues with holders manipulating withdrawals by transferring tokens to claim multiple times. As redeemable tokens can be burned it is possible for the total supply to decrease over time, which naively would result in claims being larger retroactively (prorata increases beyond what can be paid). For example: - Alice and Bob hold 50 rTKN each, 100 total supply - 100 TKN is deposited - Alice withdraws 50% of 100 TKN => alice holds 50 TKN escrow holds 50 TKN - Alice burns her 50 rTKN - Bob attempts to withdraw his 50 rTKN which is now 100% of supply - Escrow tries to pay 100% of 100 TKN deposited and fails as the escrow   only holds 50 TKN (alice + bob = 150%). To avoid the escrow allowing more withdrawals than deposits we include the total rTKN supply in the key of each deposit mapping, and include it in the emmitted event. Alice and Bob must read the events offchain and make a withdrawal relative to the rTKN supply as it was at deposit time. Many deposits can be made under a single rTKN supply and will all combine to a single withdrawal but deposits made across different supplies will require multiple withdrawals. Alice or Bob could burn their tokens before withdrawing and would simply withdraw zero or only some of the deposited TKN. This hurts them individually, so they SHOULD check their indexer for claimable assets in the escrow before considering a burn. But neither of them can cause the other to be able to withdraw more or less relative to the supply as it was at the time of TKN being deposited, or to trick the escrow into overpaying more TKN than was deposited under a given `Sale`. A griefer could attempt to flood the escrow with many dust deposits under many different supplies in an attempt to confuse alice/bob. They are free to filter out events in their indexer that come from an unknown depositor or fall below some dust value threshold. Tokens may also exit the escrow as an `undeposit` call where the depositor receives back the tokens they deposited. As above the depositor must provide the rTKN supply from `deposit` time in order to `undeposit`. As `withdraw` and `undeposit` both represent claims on the same tokens they are mutually exclusive outcomes, hence the need for an escrow. The escrow will process `withdraw` only if the `Sale` is reporting a complete and successful raise. Similarly `undeposit` will only return tokens after the `Sale` completes and reports failure. While the `Sale` is in active distribution neither `withdraw` or `undeposit` will move tokens. This is necessary in part because it is only safe to calculate entitlements once the redeemable tokens are fully distributed and frozen. Because much of the redeemable token supply will never be sold, and then burned, `depositPending` MUST be called rather than `deposit` while the raise is active. When the raise completes anon can call `sweepPending` which will calculate and emit a `Deposit` event for a useful `supply`. Any supported ERC20 token can be deposited at any time BUT ONLY under a `Sale` contract that is the child of the `TrustFactory` that the escrow is deployed for. `TrustEscrow` is used to prevent a `Sale` from changing the pass/fail outcome once it is known due to a bug/attempt to double spend escrow funds. This mechanism is very similar to the native burn mechanism on `redeemableERC20` itself under `redeem` but without requiring any tokens to be burned in the process. Users can claim the same token many times safely, simply receiving 0 tokens if there is nothing left to claim. This does NOT support rebase/elastic token _balance_ mechanisms on the escrowed token as the escrow has no way to track deposits/withdrawals other than 1:1 conservation of input/output. For example, if 100 tokens are deposited under two different trusts and then that token rebases all balances to half, there will be 50 tokens in the escrow but the escrow will attempt transfers up to 100 tokens between the two trusts. Essentially the first 50 tokens will send and the next 50 tokens will fail because the trust literally doesn't have 100 tokens at that point. Elastic _supply_ tokens are supported as every token to be withdrawn must be first deposited, with the caveat that if some mechanism can mint/burn/transfer tokens out from under the escrow contract directly, this will break internal accounting much like the rebase situation. Using a real-world example, stETH from LIDO would be NOT be supported as the balance changes every day to reflect incoming ETH from validators, but wstETH IS supported as balances remain static while the underlying assets per unit of wstETH increase each day. This is of course exactly why wstETH was created in the first place. Every escrowed token has a separate space in the deposited/withdrawn mappings so that some broken/malicious/hacked token that leads to incorrect token movement in/out of the escrow cannot impact other tokens, even for the same trust and redeemable.",
