These should be exposed\\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\\n *\\n * ```\\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\");\\n * ```\\n *\\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions.

Each role has an associated admin role, and only\\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\\n *\\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\\n *\\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\\n * grant and revoke this role.

A government\\n/// regulator is going to want a government issued ID cross-referenced against\\n/// international sanctions. A fan of some social media influencer wants to\\n/// see a verified account on that platform. An open source software project\\n/// should show a github profile. A security token may need evidence from an\\n/// accountant showing accredited investor status. There are so many ways in\\n/// which BOTH sides of a fundraise may need to verify something about\\n/// themselves to each other via a THIRD PARTY that Rain cannot assume much.\\n///\\n/// The trust model and process for Rain verification is:\\n///\\n/// - There are many `Verify` contracts, each represents a specific\\n///   verification method with a (hopefully large) set of possible reviewers.\\n/// - The verifyee compiles some evidence that can be referenced in some\\n///   relevant system. It could be a session ID in a KYC provider's database or\\n///   a tweet from a verified account, etc. The evidence is passed to the\\n///   `Verify` contract as raw bytes so it is opaque onchain, but visible as an\\n///   event to verifiers.\\n/// - The verifyee calls `add` _for themselves_ to initialize their state and\\n///   emit the evidence for their account, after which they _cannot change_\\n///   their submission without appealing to someone who can remove. This costs\\n///   gas, so why don't we simply ask the user to sign something and have an\\n///   approver verify the signed data? Because we want to leverage both the\\n///   censorship resistance and asynchronous nature of the underlying\\n///   blockchain. Assuming there are N possible approvers, we want ANY 1 of\\n///   those N approvers to be able to review and approve an application. If the\\n///   user is forced to submit their application directly to one SPECIFIC\\n///   approver we lose this property. In the gasless model the user must then\\n///   rely on their specific approver both being online and not to censor the\\n///   request. It's also possible that many accounts add the same evidence,\\n///   after all it will be public in the event logs, so it is important for\\n///   approvers to verify the PAIRING between account and evidence.\\n/// - ANY account with the `APPROVER` role can review the evidence by\\n///   inspecting the event logs. IF the evidence is valid then the `approve`\\n///   function should be called by the approver. Approvers MAY also approve and\\n///   implicitly add any account atomically if the account did not previously\\n///   add itself.\\n/// - ANY account with the `BANNER` role can veto either an add OR a prior\\n///   approval. In the case of a false positive, i.e. where an account was\\n///   mistakenly approved, an appeal can be made to a banner to update the\\n///   status. Bad accounts SHOULD BE BANNED NOT REMOVED. When an account is\\n///   removed, its onchain state is once again open for the attacker to\\n///   resubmit new fraudulent evidence and potentially be reapproved.\\n///   Once an account is banned, any attempt by the account holder to change\\n///   their status, or an approver to approve will be rejected. Downstream\\n///   consumers of a `State` MUST check for an existing ban. Banners MAY ban\\n///   and implicity add any account atomically if the account did not\\n///   previously add itself.\\n///   - ANY account with the `REMOVER` role can scrub the `State` from an\\n///   account. Of course, this is a blockchain so the state changes are all\\n///   still visible to full nodes and indexers in historical data, in both the\\n///   onchain history and the event logs for each state change. This allows an\\n///   account to appeal to a remover in the case of a MISTAKEN BAN or also in\\n///   the case of a MISTAKEN ADD (e.g. mistake in evidence), effecting a\\n///   \\\"hard reset\\\" at the contract storage level.\\n///\\n/// Banning some account with an invalid session is NOT required. It is\\n/// harmless for an added session to remain as `Status.Added` indefinitely.\\n/// For as long as no approver decides to approve some invalid added session it\\n/// MUST be treated as equivalent to a ban by downstream contracts. This is\\n/// important so that admins are only required to spend gas on useful actions.\\n///\\n/// In addition to `Approve`, `Ban`, `Remove` there are corresponding events\\n/// `RequestApprove`, `RequestBan`, `RequestRemove` that allow for admins to be\\n/// notified that some new evidence must be considered that may lead to each\\n/// action. `RequestApprove` is automatically submitted as part of the `add`\\n/// call, but `RequestBan` and `RequestRemove` must be manually called\\n///\\n/// Rain uses standard Open Zeppelin `AccessControl` and is agnostic to how the\\n/// approver/remover/banner roles and associated admin roles are managed.\\n/// Ideally the more credibly neutral qualified parties assigend to each role\\n/// for each `Verify` contract the better. This improves the censorship\\n/// resistance of the verification process and the responsiveness of the\\n/// end-user experience.\\n///\\n/// Ideally the admin account assigned at deployment would renounce their admin\\n/// rights after establishing a more granular and appropriate set of accounts\\n/// with each specific role.\\n///\\n/// There is no requirement that any of the priviledged accounts with roles are\\n/// a single-key EOA, they may be multisig accounts or even a DAO with formal\\n/// governance processes mediated by a smart contract.\\n///\\n/// Every action emits an associated event and optionally calls an onchain\\n/// callback on a `IVerifyCallback` contract set during initialize. As each\\n/// action my be performed in bulk dupes are not rolled back, instead the\\n/// events are emitted for every time the action is called and the callbacks\\n/// and onchain state changes are deduped. For example, an approve may be\\n/// called twice for a single account, but by different approvers, potentially\\n/// submitting different evidence for each approval. In this case the time of\\n/// the first approve will be used and the onchain callback will be called for\\n/// the first transaction only, but BOTH approvals will emit an event.
